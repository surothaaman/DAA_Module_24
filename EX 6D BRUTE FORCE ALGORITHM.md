# EX 6D BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM
## DATE:10.05.2025
## AIM:
To write a python program using brute force method of searching for the given substring in the main string.

## Algorithm:
```
1.Take the main string and the substring as input.
2.Find the lengths of both strings.
3.Loop through the main string from index 0 to len(main) - len(substring).
4.At each position, extract a slice equal to the length of the substring.
5.Compare the slice with the substring; if they match, print the starting index.
6.Continue until all possible positions are checked.

```
## Program:
```

To implement the program using brute force method of searching for the given substring in the main string.

def match(string,sub):
    l = len(string)
    ls = len(sub)
    start = sub[0]
    for i in range(l-ls+1):
        if string[i:i+ls]==sub:
            print(f"Found at index {i}")

str1=input()
str2=input()

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the above program was executed successfully for searching the substring at respective index.
